/* Task is to write a JS program to check whether two given integers are similar or not, if a given
divisor divides both integers and it does not divide either. For example, x = 10, y = 30, and z = 300,
we can replace $ with a multiple operator (*) to obtain x * y = z   */

//Is part of the question missing? There isn't a '$' anywhere in the text. Skip for now and
//check on this one.
